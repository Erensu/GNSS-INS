### Localization package (This package is still under development)

This package seeks to provide navigation solution in diverse scenarios using different sensors, with:
## Expected Capabilities (under development)
- evaluation of algorithm: filtering (eg.EKF) and smoothing (eg. factor graph)

## Using

- GNSS(GPS/BeiDou in Asian area): raw measurements is better (robust GNSS). 
- INS: using Xsens MTi 10. state-of-the-art pre-integration is applied.
- LiDAR odometry: using LiDAR odometry by matching two frame of point clouds.
- LiDAR matching: using LiDAR matching between map and real-time point clouds.

## Package description
   - amsi- adaptive multi-sensor integration package
   - nlosExclusion- GNSS NLOS exclusion package (under development)
   - rtklibros- rtklib in ros package [rtklib](https://github.com/tomojitakasu/RTKLIB)
   - Mapping- LiDAR mapping and its integration with GNSS (in local frame) (SLAM)

## Currently support
- loosely coupled GNSS/INS integration using EKF at [here](https://github.com/weisongwen/GNSS-INS/blob/master/amsi/apps/gps_imu_loose_ekf.cpp).
- tightly coupled GNSS/INS integration using EKF at [here](https://github.com/weisongwen/GNSS-INS/blob/master/amsi/apps/gps_imu_tight_ekf.cpp).
- loosely coupled GNSS/INS integration using factor graph at [here](https://github.com/weisongwen/GNSS-INS/blob/master/amsi/apps/gps_imu_loose_fg.cpp).
- tightly coupled GNSS/INS integration using factor graph at here (to be developed).

## How to use this for your data

The data for public will be opened soon,
